# Agent Rules

## User guide

- Any new feature, rule change, renamed field, import behavior change, document-template behavior change, dispatcher logic change, or settings change must be accompanied by an update to the in-app user guide.
- The main guide is implemented in `src/components/user-guide-page.tsx`.
- Keep the guide user-facing: describe what the user sees, what to click, what the system checks, and practical cases.

## Database migrations

- Never write migration SQL files manually.
- Treat `src/db/schema.ts` as the source of truth for database shape.
- For schema changes, update the Drizzle schema first, then generate migrations with `pnpm db:generate`.
- Review generated migrations before running them, but do not hand-author migration files.
- Apply local migrations with `pnpm db:migrate`.
- Always apply migrations to a remote database with `pnpm db:remote-migration`. This script uses `DATABASE_URL_REMOTE_FOR_MIGRATIONS`; never run `drizzle-kit migrate` directly against a remote database and never use the app's `DATABASE_URL` for remote migrations.
